  By doing this workshop, I could find 'constexpr' keyword at the w1_p1.cpp file.
It looks similar with 'const' keyword but its function was slightly different with 'constexpr'.
By using 'constexpr' keyword, the program can initialize the variable at compile time but if 
The program use 'const' keyword, the variable is not sure to be initialized at compile time or run time.
  Secondly, in terms of the difference between internal linkage and external linkage, internal linkage
Refers to everything only in scope of translation unit. So I used 'static' keyword to make 'counter' variable to be initialized once during run-time On the other hand, External linkage refers to variables which exist beyond a specific translation unit. In this program I set the tax rate and discount rate as external variables 
With 'extern' keyword
  Moreover, I try to use the 'rule of 3' so I add copy constructor, copy assignment operator and destructor to
do 'deep copy' and at part 2, I upgraded 'read' function by adding function in string library. 
These functions have no constraints on the size of the character array, so I can only use as much memory as I need.
